## Public privacy boundary

This public README is limited to the project overview, approved concept material and evidence that can be shared openly. Do not publish API keys, passwords, private tokens, Wi-Fi or internal network settings, private camera footage, personal or precise location data, detailed security configurations, unreleased engineering specifications, or confidential commercial plans. Keep sensitive material in an appropriately access-controlled private location. If a credential may have been exposed, revoke it; removing it from the latest commit does not remove it from Git history.

## Open-source-first engineering

PUI89 prioritises open-source software, transparent licensing, reproducible workflows and evidence-led collaboration. Model weights, datasets, hosted services and hardware are assessed separately for provenance, licence terms, security, data handling, resource requirements and intended use. Public availability alone does not establish permission for reuse or commercial deployment.

## Project overview

**PUI89 AI Home Assistant Robot** is an indoor, four-wheel assistant concept for home-condition awareness and everyday support. The project is software-first and evidence-led.

- **Stage:** early software foundation and product requirements; no completed robot or real sensor integration is established.
- **Purpose:** help residents notice changes, understand evidence and decide when human attention is needed.
- **Websites:** [English](https://pui89.github.io/home.html) · [ภาษาไทย](https://pui89.github.io/home-th.html) · [PUI89 portfolio](https://pui89.github.io/)
- **Repository:** [Pui89/AI-Home-Safety-Robot](https://github.com/Pui89/AI-Home-Safety-Robot)
- **Related product:** [PUI89 AI NOMAD](https://github.com/Pui89/AI-Mobile-Assistant-Robot) is a separate indoor/outdoor and travel platform.

## Compact physical design target — AI HOME

The current proposed compact form factor is:

| Parameter | Design target |
|---|---:|
| Width (W) | **25 cm** |
| Length / depth (D) | **25 cm** |
| Height (H) | **40 cm** |
| Maximum total mass | **8 kg**, including the battery |

These are **provisional design targets**, not measured prototype specifications. The dimensions describe the intended external envelope of the assembled unit, including its wheels and fixed sensor housing. The 8 kg limit includes the battery, chassis, wheels, motors, electronics, sensors, wiring and enclosure.

**Design intent:** a compact, stable, four-wheel indoor assistant that can fit into a small home while carrying its sensing and computing equipment. Keep heavier components low in the chassis, protect wheels and moving parts, provide adequate ventilation and service access, and avoid sharp external edges. HOME remains an indoor home-condition awareness product; AI NOMAD is the separate portable travel/outdoor assistant.

**Engineering checks required before freezing the design:** verify the complete mass budget against selected components; centre of gravity and tip resistance; wheel clearance and floor transitions; obstacle and collision behaviour; cable snagging; thermal management and ventilation; battery containment and charging safety; acoustic performance; cleaning and maintenance access; and safe supervised stopping. The 25 × 25 × 40 cm envelope and 8 kg limit must be checked against the actual sensor layout and enclosure.

**Capability boundary:** this target does not imply stair climbing, operation on rough terrain, water resistance, fire resistance, an IP rating, certified alarm capability, or validated safety performance. Certified household protection devices remain primary. No prototype dimensions, measured mass or physical validation are currently established by this design target.

## What it is designed to monitor

Research areas include water leaks and moisture; temperature, humidity and heat; smoke/fire-related signals from appropriate certified devices; non-invasive electrical indicators; visible surface or vibration changes; and environmental changes such as sound and light.

These are monitoring and evidence-research areas—not validated detection, diagnosis or prevention capabilities.

## Shared AI Core

The project is designed to use versioned `WorldState`, `Observation`, `ActionProposal` and `FailureReport` contracts, with evidence provenance, timestamps, sensor-health checks, uncertainty handling, safety gates and human-reviewed recommendations.

## Safety and privacy

- Certified smoke, fire, carbon-monoxide and electrical protection devices remain primary.
- Never delay evacuation or emergency procedures for AI analysis.
- Do not control locks, breakers, valves, appliances or certified alarms.
- Do not claim structural, fire, electrical or mould diagnosis without suitable independent validation.
- Stop when localization, obstacle evidence or battery state is uncertain; minimise personal data.

## Development approach

Requirements and hazard analysis → software contracts and synthetic tests → evidence reports → simulation → reviewed sensor integration. No physical safety performance, real-world sensor accuracy or certified function is currently claimed.

## Engineering foundation — Phase 2

The following documents define the proposed engineering baseline. They are requirements and test plans, **not evidence that a robot or safety function has been built or validated**.

- [Product requirements](docs/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md) — scope, users, measurable requirements and design targets.
- [System architecture](docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) — evidence flow, shared AI Core contracts and human-review boundary.
- [Safety and cybersecurity requirements](docs/SAFETY_AND_CYBERSECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md) — safety gates, privacy and security controls.
- [Verification and validation plan](docs/VERIFICATION_AND_VALIDATION_PLAN.md) — software, simulation, bench and supervised test stages.
- [Hardware specification](docs/HARDWARE_SPECIFICATION.md) — component selection criteria and TBD engineering values; research only, no purchasing.
- [Preliminary internal layout and 8 kg mass budget](docs/AI_HOME_INTERNAL_LAYOUT_AND_MASS_BUDGET.md) — packaging zones, category-level BOM and engineering gates; planning allocations only, not measured weights or selected parts.

### Software-only MVP demonstrator

The first AI HOME MVP work is being developed as a browser-only demonstrator. It uses synthetic temperature and humidity values; it is not connected to physical sensors.

- [MVP product specification](docs/MVP_PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION.md)
- [Sensor integration specification](docs/SENSOR_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION.md) — interface and validation requirements; no part selected or purchase approved.
- [Local dashboard specification](docs/DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATION.md)
- [Test and validation plan](docs/TEST_AND_VALIDATION_PLAN.md)
- [Open the local dashboard demo](demo/ai-home-dashboard/index.html) — download or clone the repository and open this HTML file in a modern browser; no installation is required.

The demo has configurable example thresholds and normal, warning, stale, disconnected and invalid scenarios. All readings are simulated, session-only and local to the browser. This work does not establish real sensor accuracy, a built robot, certified alarm capability or physical safety performance.

## Development stage

**Stage:** Stage 2 of 5 — Architecture and early software foundation
**ระยะการพัฒนา:** สถาปัตยกรรมและพื้นฐานซอฟต์แวร์

**Shared framework:** [PUI89 Development Stage Standard](https://github.com/Pui89/Pui89.github.io/blob/main/docs/PUI89_DEVELOPMENT_STAGE_STANDARD.md)

**Current stage:** Early software foundation & requirements  
**ขั้นการพัฒนา:** พื้นฐานซอฟต์แวร์และข้อกำหนดระยะแรก

**Evidence:** Product requirements, architecture, software contracts and early adapter/test foundations are documented.

**Limitations:** No built robot, real sensor integration, certified alarm, or validated home-safety performance is established.

**Next milestone:** Complete a software-only home-safety demonstrator using mock sensor inputs and explicit failure states.

## Hugging Face vision models — opt-in local integration

This repository now includes real Hugging Face checkpoint adapters in [`pui89_models/hf_vision.py`](pui89_models/hf_vision.py), with project-specific usage boundaries in [`docs/HUGGING_FACE_MODEL_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/HUGGING_FACE_MODEL_INTEGRATION.md).

- **OWLv2:** `google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble` for text-conditioned object proposals.
- **Intel DPT-Hybrid:** `Intel/dpt-hybrid-midas` for relative scene depth where appropriate; not calibrated distance or physical depth.
- **local-first default:** no packages or model weights are installed/downloaded automatically; CPU-only inference, local cache only by default, no hosted inference API or cloud GPU.
- **Evidence status:** adapter code is added; model inference and project-specific accuracy are NOT YET TESTED. Outputs remain uncertain observations for human review, never actuator commands.

## Security, malware and supply-chain protection

Security policy: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Report suspected vulnerabilities privately; do not post resident data, camera footage, access details or exploit steps publicly.

Project-specific controls and review requirements:
- Treat sensor readings, camera/audio inputs, network messages, configuration files and imported logs as untrusted.
- Validate source, timestamps, ranges, file sizes and stale/conflicting readings; fail safely when evidence is unreliable.
- Never commit credentials, resident information, floor plans, private recordings or network secrets.
- Review dependencies, model files and GitHub Actions for provenance, licences and vulnerabilities before adoption.
- AI recommendations must not automatically operate locks, breakers, valves, appliances or emergency systems; retain human authority.
- Use least-privilege CI and never expose secrets to untrusted pull-request code.

A scan or passing test is evidence only for the checks actually run; it does not establish whether the repository contains malware or vulnerabilities.

## Shared PUI89 standards

Project-wide guidance is maintained centrally to avoid repeating the same framework in every repository:

- [Simple, Safe and Professional Engineering Standard](https://github.com/Pui89/Pui89.github.io/blob/main/docs/PUI89_SIMPLE_SAFE_PROFESSIONAL_STANDARD.md)
- [Project strength scorecard method](https://github.com/Pui89/Pui89.github.io/blob/main/docs/PROJECT_STRENGTH_SCORECARD.md)
- [Security policy](SECURITY.md)



## Spatial Intelligence integration

See [the project-specific spatial integration profile](docs/spatial-intelligence/README.md). Runtime sensor integration and physical validation remain pending.

## Evidence-backed project review status

**Project:** PUI89 AI HOME  
**README snapshot (13 November 2026): 0 completed evidence-backed reviews.** This snapshot is not auto-synchronised; the live [PUI89 portfolio review register](https://pui89.github.io/#evidence-backed-project-reviews) is the source of truth.

This is a review-record count, not a statement that development or testing has not occurred. Engineering work, CI runs, test results and simulation evidence may support a review, but do not automatically count as a completed review.

A review is counted only when its record includes all required fields: **completed status, review date, defined scope, reviewer role, outcome, and at least one supporting evidence reference**. Drafts, ratings, stars, page views and comments are excluded.

The portfolio-wide count is published on the [PUI89 website](https://pui89.github.io/#evidence-backed-project-reviews). Refresh this README snapshot when the shared register changes.
